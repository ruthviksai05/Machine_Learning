# Machine_Learning
The forecasting methods used in retail, particularly for brick-and-mortar grocery stores, are currently subjective, lack sufficient data support, and are not easily automated. 
This poses challenges for retailers, as inaccurate forecasts can lead to issues such as overstocking perishable goods or running out of popular items, resulting in lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction. 
The complexity of the problem is heightened by factors such as the addition of new store locations, diverse product offerings, changing seasonal preferences, and unpredictable product marketing strategies.
